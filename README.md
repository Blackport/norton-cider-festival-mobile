# norton-cider-festival-mobile
The Norton Cider Festival has commissioned a redesign of their website for their 30th annual event in 2018! The redesigned website will target mobile devices first, then expand to tablets and desktops. Fellow geeks living in Norton, Ohio are invited to contribute! This effort is led by the Cider Festival's Webmaster, David Walton.
