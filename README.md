The Norton Cider Festival has commissioned a redesign of their website for their 30th annual event in 2018! The redesigned website will target mobile devices first, expand to tablets, and then finish with desktop widths. If you either live in or love Norton, Ohio you are invited to contribute! The redesign is being led by the Cider Festival's Webmaster, David Walton.

Our current website: [www.nortonciderfestival.com](http://www.nortonciderfestival.com/)

### All interest levels are welcome!

Please start by [creating a free account on GitHub](https://github.com/join). You can then contribute in any of three categories as your skills allow and you feel comfortable doing so:

| Category      | Does this describe you? |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| [Brainstormers](#Brainstormers) | *People who have ideas about what would make the website nice.* |
| [Photographers](#Photographers) | *Shutterbugs who are willing and able to contribute existing photos or take new ones.* |
| [Coders](#Coders)        | *Programmers and user interface designers who will implement the brainstorms and photos.* |

#### Brainstormers

Individuals wishing to participate in the brainstorming process of the project are asked to first introduce themselves on the [introduction discussion thread](https://github.com/GeekStocks/norton-cider-festival-mobile/issues/1). Afterwards, use the green "New Issue" button on the [Issues tab](https://github.com/GeekStocks/norton-cider-festival-mobile/issues) to submit ideas for discussion by the group. In the brainstorming phase of the project, we will observe these points:

+   _There are no dumb ideas. Let's hear what you are thinking!_
+   _All constructive criticism is welcome as long as it is sincere and respectful._
+   _Contributors should expect to have their ideas challenged; its part of the creative process._
+   _Learn to use the "thumbs up / thumbs down" feature of the discussion thread to indicate your thoughts._
+   _Not all ideas can get used; David Walton will have to make those decisions. And the NCF committee keeps <u>him</u> in check._

#### Photographers

Whether you are a professional looking to contribute back to your community, or just have an awesome camera on your phone, you are invited to contribute your photo to the project. The brainstorming process will likely yield a few requests for photographs that reinforce the theme of various sections of the website. It will be your task to either sort through your existing works or shoot new ones. Please introduce yourself on the [introduction discussion thread](https://github.com/GeekStocks/norton-cider-festival-mobile/issues/1)! The following rules surrounding submissions will apply:

+   _<u>You</u> must be the photographer in order to contribute a photo. We are respectful of copyright and will be documenting and crediting your work on an "attributions" page of the website, not in the photo itself._
+   _Images submitted and discussed through the [Issues tab](https://github.com/GeekStocks/norton-cider-festival-mobile/issues) can and perhaps should have a copyright notice on them since we don't control GitHub. The unaltered copy without copyright notice (used for the production website) can be submitted offline to protect your work if you desire this._

#### Coders

_Your age doesn't matter!_ If you are still in high school or college, that's great, _we want you_! If you're a lady who would love to hack on something worthwhile in a supportive environment, that's super because we want to encourage more ["girls in tech"](https://girlsintech.org/). If you're a retired coder looking to keep current, you'll find company here!

All you need is some ability and a desire to work on a highly visible project. The NCF website was visited by over 6,000 unique visitors during the 29th annual Norton Cider Festival in 2017. If you desire to work with the most cutting edge code base and have a passion for beautiful code, you're in the right place. We're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to hack our HTML with, [Bootstrap's 4Beta2 version](http://getbootstrap.com/) to handle mobile / multiple width handling, [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to pre-process our color themes, [PurifyCSS](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/purifycss-webpack) to cull any unused Bootstrap CSS, [Spritesmith](https://github.com/twolfson/gulp.spritesmith) to streamline images, the lightweight [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) for view model (MVVM) integration, and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to wrap it all up into one gorgeous, efficient package. All that gets deployed to the #1 cloud provider in the United States - [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) - via a blazing fast [Cloudfront distro](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/).

All contributions are given to the project under the open source [MIT License](https://github.com/GeekStocks/norton-cider-festival-mobile/blob/master/LICENSE) and will likely be used by the Norton Cider Festival. When done, you can feel free to advertise your involvement on your resume. If you are a student and would like a letter of recommendation to further your tech career, you can provide a self-addressed, stamped envelope to David Walton and he will return a letter to you at the project's conclusion.
